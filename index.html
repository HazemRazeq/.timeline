<h2 class="com">The Invention of the Phone</h2>
<p class="p1">The first telephone was created in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell just hours before Elisha Gray. Before the telephone that was created by Bell, they used a machine called a telegraph which they have used for 30 years and it could only receive one message at a time, and it was in Morse code. Bell and Watson continued to work on the harmonic telegraph at the insistence of Hubbard and a few other financial backers. He worked to make it better and he created a telephone. The very first permanent outdoor telephone wire was completed in 1877. It stretched just three miles. This was closely followed in the U.S. by the world's first commercial telephone service. The phone isn't as efficient as you think it would be but it’s a start to something new. This marks the first major milestone on the invention of cell phones. This is a start for something new.</p>

<h2 class="site">Mobile Phone</h2>
<p class="p2">The first mobile phone, called the StarTAC, was invented by Motorola in 1996. The concept of "Mobile phones" was first introduced by StarTAC's predecessor, called the MicroTAC, in 1989. The concept of the mobile phone was different, and this is what they got. They stopped making them in 1994(the design of the specific phone not mobile phones in general, just the model phone). It was expansive compared to the quality now a days. It was about 3,000 dollars. The phones were huge compared to the phones we have now. The bad part about it is that you can only text and call which then was a lot but now it’s a little. You couldn't put the phone in your pocket like u can do with phone now a days. Over the course of time they shrunk it down so it can be at the point where you can put it in your pocket.</p>

<h2 class="phone">The IPHONE</h2>
<p class="p3">The company came out with a smart phone called and iPhone. The first iPhone that was released was the iPhone 2g or iPhone 1. The iPhone differs from the other mobile devices because you can do more than just call and text and it also made texting easier. They had this feature where you can put a number pass code on your phone where only you could get in if you knew the passcode. Popular social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and twitter came out onto that phone since that phone came out. Apps such as cut the rope, YouTube and jetpack joyride also came out since the phone came out. That’s why people started to buy an and let go of the first gen smart phones. Companies like Samsung came on the trend and stated making phones like that and iPhone and Samsung came in battle of creating a better phone. </p>

<h2 class="buds">Touch Id</h2>
<p class="p4">Touch Id is a major milestone in technology. How it works is you put any finger of your choice on the home button and it scans your fingerprint. Then whenever you want you can place that chosen finger and place it on the home button and it unlocks, there hasn’t been any recorded breaches or glitches to it so works pretty well but if there is any problems like if your finger is wet or something and it has a problem with reading your finger, it will just ask you to put in your passcode. The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone that had Touch Id and later that year it was launched in the iPhone 6 and 6 plus and in the iPhone 7, 7 plus, 8, 8 plus and in iPads as well. Also, the iPad air 2. This is a big milestone because it can make top secret things more secured because it needs a fingerprint to get in. </p>

<h2 class="exit">Facial Id</h2>
<p class="p5">Facial id works just like touch id but more efficient. Instead of scanning your fingers it scans your facial structure and anytime you just look at your phone it unlocks. Just like touch Id, if for some reason the scanner isn't reading your face it will ask you to put your passcode in. You can also use it for apple pay and for buying games on the app store. Apple announced Face ID during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017. They also have this on the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS max This is the latest piece of technology we have, and companies are working on improving it to maximum efficiency. Companies are also implanting this technology to hide private ideas and technology. For the US government and much more. This technology can help make private information harder to get in and access if you don’t have ur Facial structure in the database. </p>
